LSA Whisperer is a set of tools for interacting with authentication packages using their individual message protocols.
You may download prebuilt copies of LSA Whisperer from the artifacts list of a recent run of its [build workflow](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=is%3Asuccess).

Support is currently provided for the cloudap, kerberos, msv1_0, negotiate, pku2u, and schannel packages and cloudap's AzureAD plugin.
Partial or unstable support is provided for livessp, negoexts, and the security package manager (SPM).
Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/wiki) to see which message protocols are currently supported. 

Support for more authentication packages and package calls may be added in the future.
If you are interested in a package call that is not implemented or you see an area of the wiki that can be improved, please submit an issue on GitHub or consider making a pull request (PR) for the project.
Contributions are appreciated!

## Building

LSA Whisperer uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to generate and run the build system files for your platform.
The project does not rely on any library manager to allow it to be easily built in an offline environment if desired.
You will need the latest Windows 11 SDK and WDK that's available on [GitHub's runner images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/windows/Windows2022-Readme.md), which at the time of this writing is 10.0.26100.0.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer.git
cd lsa-whisperer/builds
cmake .. -A {Win32 | x64}
cmake --build .
```

By default CMake will build both the `lsa-whisperer` utility and the `sspi` static library it uses.
The `lsa-whisperer` utility will be linked against the static version of the runtime library which will allow the tool to run as a standalone program on other hosts.

If the Python modules in the `requirements.txt` file are installed, then CMake will build the bofs that are included with this project.
If [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) is additionally installed, then CMake will also build the documentation for the `sspi` static library as well.

If you experience issues related to Python when generating build files, please ensure that the Python installation that CMake located has the required Python modules installed.
CMake will report the Python installation it located the first time you attempt to generate build files.
CMake may locate and use a seperate Python installation than anticipated if have multiple versions of Python are installed.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to [SpecterOps](https://specterops.io/) for supporting this research and to my coworkers who have helped with its development.

Thank you [Elad](https://twitter.com/elad_shamir) and [Lee](https://twitter.com/tifkin_) for both inspiring this tool and the research, support, and collaboration throughout its development.
Elad additionally developed operational use cases for [msv1_0](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/wiki/msv1_0) and Lee both introduced me to [cloudap](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/wiki/cloudap) and showed it's potential for recovering authentication data.
Thank you as well to [Will](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) for always being a good sounding board and helping test the tool, [Daniel](https://twitter.com/hotnops) for answering my AzureAD questions, and [Kai](https://twitter.com/mhskai2017) for helping both research [cloudap](https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/wiki/cloudap) and add Kerberos support.
