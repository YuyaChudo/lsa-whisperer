= Live SSP
:toc: macro

Livessp is a legacy SSP that supported authenticating users using their Microsoft Account.
Microsoft has since ported and updated the livessp code as a cloudap plugin.
The cloudap plugin is documented on the https://github.com/EvanMcBroom/lsa-whisperer/wiki/cloudap#microsoft-account-functions[cloudap wiki page].

| `0x00` | RenameAccount                     |                    | `>=6.2`    | LiveRenameAccount
| `0x01` | TransferCredential                | _Planned_          | `>=6.2`    | LiveTransferCredential

| `0x03` | SetUnsignedProofOfPossessionToken |                    | `>=6.3`    | LiveSetUnsignedProofOfPossessionToken
| `0x04` | DeleteProofOfPossessionToken      |                    | `>=6.3`    | LiveDeleteProofOfPossessionToken
|===

NOTE: The internal function will be located in `livessp.dll`.

In NT 6.2 `SeTcbPrivilege` was required for all calls.
NT 6.3 removed that requirment for all calls except for `TransferCredential` which still requires `SeTcbPrivilege`.

=== GetSignedProofOfPossessionToken

Get a proof of possession (PoP) token for authentication.
The returned data will contain a PoP token for the device.
If the current user logged on with a Microsoft account, then their PoP token will be returned as well.

```
live GetSignedProofOfPossessionToken
```

=== TransferCredential

Transfer data from one logon session to another logon session.
The specific data that is transferred is still being determined.
`SeTcbPrivilege` is required.
